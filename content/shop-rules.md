## Wood Finishes, Paint, Glue, Etc

### Storage

- Products marked 'FLAMMABLE' should be stored in the yellow flammables cabinet
- Products marked 'COMBUSTIBLE' may be stored in the red general storage cabinet.
- Wood finishes should not be left in the shop when not in use.

### ⚠️ Safety

- Some finishes, e.g. polyurethane, will generate harmful fumes.
  - Make sure the area is properly ventilated.
  - Make sure no other shop member needs the area before the fumes are gone.
- Be careful with oily rags.
  - Drying oils (linseed oil, tung oil, etc) generate heat when they cure. A crumpled up rag soaked in a drying oil can self combust.
  - Don’t burn the shop down!
  - Let oily rags dry on the designated metal tray, and make sure they’re laid out flat. When they’re 110% dry, toss them in the garbage.
  - If you’re in doubt about how to handle this, ask for help.
