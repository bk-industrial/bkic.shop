# Brooklyn Industrial Arts Collective

## Purpose

To provide affordable and functional workshop space, tools, and a community of like-minded shopmates.

## Assets

The proto-coop owns no assets. Any expenses incurred or consumable materials required will be funded by contribution of the Members.

## Membership

Members are those who are tenants of the space at 544 Park Ave, Ste 332 and who agree to split the costs of renting the space and of maintaining the shop according to the rules determined by the group.

## Governance

### Voting

Each Member shall be entitled to one vote on any subject that requires voting
by members.

The Members may make, amend or repeal the bylaws of the Cooperative by popular vote.

### Board

A board can be elected by popular vote of the Members for a term of one year

Any member of the board can be recalled by popular vote of the Members.

The board will consist of three officers:

- Treasurer
- Shop Manager
- Community Manager

Examples of actions the board may take:

- Signing a lease provided that the membership have accepted the general terms
- Purchase of replacement filters for dust collection
- Negotiating a sublease with a month-to-month tenant

Examples of actions the board may not take:

- Dissolving the Cooperative
- Kicking out a member
- Spending more than $200 on un-budgeted discretionary expenses in a given month
- Amending the bylaws of the Cooperative

For those decisions the board is not empowered to take, it will produce proposals which can be voted on by Members.

Popular votes by the membership will be decided by simple majority, except:

- Commiting to increasing our monthly fees, such as by subscribing to a service, renting a new space, etc., will require unanimous consent
